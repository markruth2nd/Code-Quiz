Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this code is to work with some starter code and build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The aim is to have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

Looking at the starter code proviced I can see that the main coding will be completed within JavaScript(JS), I will create 3 JS files which are referenced in the HTML files; logic, questions and scores.  

THE SCORES: JS file will need 2 functions to print high scores and the other to clearHighScores as well as code to allow the 'clear' button to use the clearHighScores function when the the user clicks the 'clear' button.

QUESTIONS JS: in this JS files I will create a variable where I can place all my multiple questions which will include the Title of the question, the multiple choices as well as an alert when answer seletected for each multiple choice question. 

LOGIC JS: in this JS file I will add variables & create functions that keep track of the Quiz state, this includes which question the quiz is displaying or up to, the timer within the quiz as well as functions which will allow the user to interact with the quiz by starting the quiz, submitting users answers, sound effects submitting user Initials in the highscores section.
The Function created: getQuestion, question,Click, startQuize, quizEnd, clockTick, saveHighScore, checkForEnter
